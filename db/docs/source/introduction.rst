Introduction
============

Purpose
-------

This document provides detailed metadata (data dictionary) for the NZ Facilities data published on the LINZ Data Service: https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/105568

Background
----------

The NZ Facilities dataset described here has been used to enrich the attributes for the existing `NZ Building Outlines <https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/101290-nz-building-outlines/>`_, as well as provides additional open data for various stakeholders to map risk modelling, environmental assessment, urban development, resilience planning in addition to the visualization and physical location of facilities and the buildings within them.

Prior to publishing the NZ Facilities dataset, the `NZ Building Outlines <https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/101290-nz-building-outlines/>`_ dataset contained name and use attributes of only supermarkets. The NZ Facilities dataset containing hospital and school facilities was used to help add hospital and school names and uses to the building outlines dataset.



Description
-----------

The NZ Facilities dataset represents boundaries of facilities, currently hospitals and schools, within mainland New Zealand containing data from `NationalMap <https://www.nationalmap.co.nz>`_, `Ministry of Education <https://www.educationcounts.govt.nz>`_ and `Ministry of Health <https://www.health.govt.nz>`_ licensed for reuse under `CC BY 4.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>`_.

A facility represents a particular activity such as a hospital or school. A facility boundary represents the extent of the land which appears to be used by a facility. A facility boundary can be different to corresponding cadastral parcel polygons because a facility can span across multiple parcels or be located in only part of a parcel. For example, a parcel owned by the Crown can include multiple schools and other facilities such as parks and reserves.



Data Creation process
---------------------
NationalMap facility polygons were matched and verified against authoritative data from the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education. Finally the facility boundaries were used to assign names and uses to `NZ Building Outlines <https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/101290-nz-building-outlines/>`_.

Source Data Verification
------------------------
The process of verifying the NationalMap Facilities was accomplished by first matching names and locations to an authoritative point. The matches were checked for similarity of names and distance between locations. Those with disimilar names, or large distances, were investigated further and adjusted accordingly. LINZ Aerial Imagery was used to assist in manually correcting some boundary extents.

Assigning Attributes
--------------------

The NZ Facilities attributes are derived from the authoritative source attributes and have been standardised.

Assigning Name and Use to NZ Building Outlines
-----------------------------------------------

Facility boundaries in this dataset were used to apply hospital and school building names to the `NZ Building Outlines <https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/101290-nz-building-outlines/>`_ dataset published on the LINZ Data Service. NZ Facilities and `NZ Building Outlines <https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/101290-nz-building-outlines/>`_ were compared and any building outline whose centroid intersected with a facility boundary, was assign the name and use of that facility boundary.
