Introduction
============

Purpose
-------

This document provides detailed metadata (data dictionary) for the NZ Facilities data published on the LINZ Data Service: https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/105568

Background
----------

The NZ Facilities dataset described here has been used to enrich the attributes for the existing `NZ Building Outlines <https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/101290-nz-building-outlines/>`_, as well as provides additional open data for various stakeholders to map risk modelling, environmental assessment, urban development, resilience planning in addition to the visualization and physical location of facilities and the buildings within them.

Prior to publishing the NZ Facilities dataset, the `NZ Building Outlines <https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/101290-nz-building-outlines/>`_ dataset contained name and use attributes of only supermarkets. The NZ Facilities dataset containing hospital and school facilities was used to help add hospital and school names and uses to the building outlines dataset.

The NZ Facilities data described below represents boundaries of facilities, currently hospitals and schools, within mainland New Zealand originally sourced in early 2021 from a combination of NationalMap and authoritative sources. Authoritative sources of these two types of attributes include the NZ Ministry of Health and NZ Ministry of Education.

Description
-----------

A facility represents a particular activity such as a hospital or school. A facility boundary represents the extent of the land which appears to be used by a facility. A facility boundary can be different to corresponding cadastral parcel polygons because a facility can span across multiple parcels or be located in only part of a parcel. For example, a parcel owned by the Crown can include multiple schools and other facilities such as parks and reserves.

NZ Facilities contains data sourced from `NationalMap <https://www.nationalmap.co.nz>`_, `Ministry of Education <https://www.educationcounts.govt.nz>`_ and `Ministry of Health <https://www.health.govt.nz>`_ licensed for reuse under `CC BY 4.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>`_.

The NZ Facilities data was produced by acquiring facility boundaries from NationalMap, and matching and verifying this against authoritative data from the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education. Finally the facility boundaries were used to assign names and uses to `NZ Building Outlines <https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/101290-nz-building-outlines/>`_.

Source Data
-----------
The source data for the NZ Facilities dataset comes from `NationalMap <https://www.nationalmap.co.nz>`_ Facility Boundaries, as well as `Ministry of Education <https://www.educationcounts.govt.nz>`_ and `Ministry of Health <https://www.health.govt.nz>`_ authoritative points.

Verifying Facilities
--------------------

The NZ Facilities data was produced by acquiring facility boundaries from NationalMap, and verifying this against authoritative point data from the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education.

The process of verifying the NationalMap Facilities was accomplished by first matching names and locations to an authoritative point. The matches were checked for similarity of names and distance between locations. Those with disimilar names, or large distances, were investigated further and adjusted accordingly. LINZ Aerial Imagery was used to assist in manually correcting some boundary extents.

Assigning Attributes
--------------------

The NZ Facilities attributes are derived from the authoritative source attributes and have been standardised.

Assigning Name and Use to `NZ Building Outlines <https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/101290-nz-building-outlines/>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Facility boundaries in this dataset were used to apply hospital and school building names to the `NZ Building Outlines <https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/101290-nz-building-outlines/>`_ dataset published on the LINZ Data Service. NZ Facilities and `NZ Building Outlines <https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/101290-nz-building-outlines/>`_ were compared and any building outline whose centroid intersected with a facility boundary, was assign the name and use of that facility boundary.
